[Does Cell phone Coverage in National Parks Contribute to Missing Persons Reports ](/pdf/Powerpoint slide Final Draft.pdf)

In this Project I used Digital Elevation Models to create a elevation map of Yosemite National Park which was used to create a viewshed based on the Cell Towers in the park to highlight areas were Cell service is available. I then used a data set of missing persons reports and found that about 60% of missing persons are lost within the cellular range.
